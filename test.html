<h2>>Get the Quality You Deserve As a Company Truck Driver</h2>
Many company truck drivers tell us there’s nothing more frustrating than not making money because of something that’s out of their control. Are you stuck because your truck broke down? Not getting offered any freight? Are you still waiting on that paycheck you earned?

That’s not right.

Spend less time worrying about the things that are out of your control. When you drive for ATS, you’ll get:

 *   Quality equipment: Drive newer trucks and pull newer trailers that go through regular ongoing maintenance.
 *   Consistent freight: Get access to a variety of freight from high-quality customers that regularly rely on ATS.
 *   The paycheck you earned: You work hard to earn your paycheck. That’s why you deserve to get it when you were promised to — which is weekly at ATS.
